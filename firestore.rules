/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Exam application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset allows any authenticated user to act as an administrator.
 * In a production environment, you should implement a more robust role-based access control system.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /students/{studentId}: Stores student profiles.
 * - /exams/{examId}: Stores exam metadata.
 * - /exams/{examId}/questions/{questionId}: Stores questions for each exam.
 * - /responses/{responseId}: Stores student responses.
